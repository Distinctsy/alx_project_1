### Project Task

## My Process

We started this project by writing the main codes in HTML and styling it in CSS. Also, we made use of CSS bootstrap in some aspects and added fontawesome CDN in the stylesheet so we can be able to use some icons. Furthermore, we added some JavaScript functionalities as part of the back-end specifically in the sign up and login forms. 

### Built With 

- HTML5 Markup
- CSS Styling
- JavaScript

### What We Learned 

This project taught us valuable lessons in front-end development, user experience design, JavaScript interactivity, and considerations for backend functionality and security. Through team collaboration, we learned about version control, communication, and project management. We also gained insights into testing, debugging, continuous learning, and basic eCommerce concepts, ultimately enhancing our technical skills and understanding of online business dynamics.
